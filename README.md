# Train Delay Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Streamlit dashboard developed as part of a Data Analytics Internship at **Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS)**.

The dashboard enables railway authorities to explore historical train delay patterns, analyze route performance, and predict delays based on real-world conditions such as weather, time, train type, and congestion level.

## Features

- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
  - Average delay by train type and day of the week
  - On-time performance trends
- **Route Performance Insights**:
  - Number of stops per train
  - Longest distance trains
- **Delay Prediction Model**:
  - Interactive input
  - Predicts delay in minutes using a Random Forest Regressor
